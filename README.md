# LD-34 | Spindulum

_LD34 Theme: **Two Button Controls / Growing**_

> Spindulum is a minimalistic action game.

- You're a red dot attached to a collector.
- Orange dots makes you grow, Blue makes you shrink.
- Rotate your collector left and right to gobble the orange dots, avoiding the blue ones.
- Gobble as much as orange dots needed to grow and fill the gray area.
- When you're big enough, press LEFT AND RIGHT to explode and advance to the next level.
- If you shrink to less than half the initial size, it's game over.
