# Ludum Dare 34 | Spindulum

> Spindulum is a minimalistic action game.

_Theme: **Two Button Controls / Growing**_

![Berry Title](art/berrytitle.png)

- You're a red dot attached to a collector
- Orange dots makes you grow, Blue makes you shrink
- Rotate your collector left and right to gobble the orange dots, avoiding the blue ones
- Gobble as much as orange dots needed to grow and fill the gray area
- When you're big enough, press LEFT AND RIGHT to explode and advance to the next level
- If you shrink to less than half the initial size, it's game over
